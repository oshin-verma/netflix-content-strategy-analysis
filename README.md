For the task of Netflix Content Strategy Analysis, we need data based on content titles, type (show or movie), genre, language, and release details (date, day of the week, season) to understand timing and content performance. Viewership metrics like hours viewed are also crucial for measuring audience engagement.
I found an ideal dataset for this task, which contains data about title, release date, language, content type (show or movie), availability status, and viewership hours of the content on Netflix of all the shows and movies released in 2023
